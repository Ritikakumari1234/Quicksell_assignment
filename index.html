      The manifest.json contains metadata that helps when the app is installed
      on mobile or desktop devices. Read more at https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder is used to reference files inside the public directory.
      It will be substituted with the actual public URL during the build process.

      For instance, "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" works for both client-side routing
      and when the app is hosted at a non-root public URL. 
      You can configure this in the build settings using `npm run build`.

      This HTML file acts as a template for the React app.
      When opened directly in the browser, it will display a blank page.

      You can add custom webfonts, meta tags, or analytics scripts here.
      The build step will inject the bundled React scripts into this <body> tag.

      Start development by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To generate a production build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
